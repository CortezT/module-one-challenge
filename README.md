# <Module 1 Challenge>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I created this repository to practice my skills in debugging code. I built this project to see where I was at in being able to debug sloppy code. Solves the code from having any repeating code and cleaning up additional spacing making it easier for other coders to read and fix any potential bugs. I learned how to combine code that seemed repetitive and not needed to make the website functional.

## Installation

- Start by importing the starter code to your github, by copying the HTTPS key. 
- Then creat a repo with the HTTPS key you copied.
- After that creat a directory you want to clone the new SSH key from the newly created repo. Once created copy the SSH key and clone it into your directory using git clone "_pasted SSH". 
- Finally your new main should be made and ready for branches to be created to edit your main.
